# Inspiration #

If you are a true lover of plantations and gardening,you know how hard it is to not end up having a new plant after every little while,and it becomes ever so hard to take notice of all the plants around you and their needs,especially their optimal water needs so that they flourish. My own family is very green oriented,we love to grow,manage all kinds of plants and it becomes hectic to cater to the different needs,we end up skipping or mixing them.Also,often when we have to go out it becomes troublesome to explain to the person caring for them about each one's water needs. This is where the idea was born out of and it really is a familiar issue that can be extended to the greens all around us!

# What it does? #

The web app gives you an interface to store information about your garden family,the plants you own and their weekly water needs ,it is connected on the backend to a firebase real time database that retains this information and whenever you visit,it'll show old logs,option to remove the plants from the family or add more plants and their water needs.

# Challenges we faced #

Starting for the first time on online databases and creating a react app to bring the vision to life had its own challenges,familiarity with the technology and using it as a medium to bring the idea into action took quite a while. Along with that learning to append backened with the user interface,adding a composite domain name brought its own set of new hurdles,most of which became learning indents!

# Accomplishments we're proud of #

Using these new tools and tech in order to successfully visualise an idea,especially one which is so personal,due to my own love towards plants and the greens,I really think this idea could be built up to be something valuable for the gardenworld and the greens all around in general.I am proud of creating,visualising and applyong this idea to a certain extent during this hackathon!

# What we learned #

Learned to work on ReactJS apps,to register for and attach an independant domain name to the site created, learned to connect the application with a real time database,working with Firebase databases and APIS,Google cloud APIS and packages like npm and yarn.

# What's next for Lettuce-Water-On-Thyme #

There are a number of functionalities that need to be added to the app for it to realise the vision it was created for:

~Adding logging in facility using Firebase Authentication and creating a user profile tab to create your personal traversal deck of plants and their needs.

~Adding more input fields for the plant water needs so as to make it more specific and useful.

~Introducing a general database deck where one can find a variety of plants and their water needs for confirmation and information.

~Connection request feature for those giving their plants to someone else's care.

And many more exciting functionalities lie in the near future for Lettuce-Water-On-Thyme!
